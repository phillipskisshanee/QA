              <li><b>Everyone on my freshman floor is Pre-Med, so I think I need to be Pre-Med too. Who do I talk to about this?</b></li>
              <p>First off, calm down. No need to hope on that Pre-Med bandwagon if you really aren't interested in the field. But if you do need to talk to someone, you will have a 4-yr. advisor to meet with. </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li><b>I just transfered here and I don't understand why I have so many advisors</b></li>
              <p>At Wash U, you will have an advisor for almost everything. Your main advisor will be your 4-yr. But students also will have a major advisor, minor advisor and career advisor (if they are on a track such as Pre-Law or Pre-Health).</p>
            </ul>

              <p>Student Financial Services will assign every student an advisor that is avaliable to answer all your financial aid questions. They also can help students find an on campus job if needed.</p>

              <li><b>I really don't want to walk to campus. Help.</b></li>
              <p>Well you are in luck my friend. Wash U offers a shuttle called the Circ (Wash U slag for Circulator) which travels to places like the Clocktower on the 40 and Brookings Hall</p>
              <p>Make sure you download the Circ app so you know exactly where it is at all times</p>

              <li><b>So a little birdie told me that there is a new Chic-fil-a in town. I don't have a car, so how can I make this journey to eat some delicious peanut oil fried chicken?</b></li>
              <p>Wash U has teamed up with Enterprise Car Rental to offer students a service called Car Share. Members of this program can reserve cars that are located at multiple places around campus for an hourly fee of $5</p>
              <p>The best part about this service is that the membership is free!</p>
