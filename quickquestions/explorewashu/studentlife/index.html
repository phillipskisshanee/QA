              <p>We are glad you asked! Connie Diekman, is the director of university nutrition at Wash U. So if your favorite fattening food around campus just magically disappears *cough, mozz sticks, cough*, then Connie is probably responsibe for it.</p>
              <p>Connie's Choice is a program that let's students know some of the healthiest options on campus. If Connie approves, then we approve</p>

              <li><b>Why is the Bunny Statue wearing a sweater?</b></li>
              <p>A few years ago, one brave student decided it was her duty to knit clothing for the Bunny. Throughout the winter season, the bunny can be seen wearing a varitey of scarves and sweaters. Dressing the Bunny has even become so popular that big events like Relay for Life or Thurtene Carnival will use the statue to advertise</p>

              <li><b>Did someone say free food?</b></li>
              <p>Just about every student group may try to bribe potential new members by offering free food at their general body and interest meetings. But there are also formal Wash U events that offer this too. <a href="http://spb.wustl.edu/events/" target="_blank"> Happy Hour</a> is a cool free event that happens almost every Thursday at 5 PM in the Gargoyle. At Happy Hour, students can indulge in free pizza, sandwitches and soda. And if you are 21, there is free beer too!</p>
