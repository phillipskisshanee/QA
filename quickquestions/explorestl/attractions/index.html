              <li><b>So about this Arch thing?</b></li>
              <p>The St. Louis Arch might just be one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city. It probably appears on any postcard or website about St. Louis. So what is this Arch anyway? A short explanation is that the Arch symbolizes Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s vision of a United States. A United States that expanded from Atlantic to Pacific. </p>

              <p>If you are looking for free, then you are in the right city. Many of the attractions located in Forest Park are free! One of the most popular attractions is the St. Louis Zoo. If you go during the Winter season, you will even get the chance to watch the penguins roam around the grounds. How cool is that?</p>
