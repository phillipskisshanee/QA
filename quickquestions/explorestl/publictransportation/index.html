              <li><b>I'm not use to riding on a railway system, how does it work?</b></li>
              <p>The local railway system is called the MetroLink. There are multiple trains which depart at various times throughout the day. These trains travel both underground and at street level.</p>
              <p>There are two lines on the MetroLink, red and blue. The two lines start at different locations, but converge to stop at the sames stops as it travels east.</p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li><b>How much are the fares?</b></li>
              <p>There are many different tickets avaliable for purchase. Popular options are the single-ride ticket which is $2.50 and the 1-day ticket which is $7.50</p>
              <p>If you plan on traveling via metro frequently, consider investing in a weekly or monthly pass. They are $27 and $78, respectively.</p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li>Can I ride the Metro without a ticket?</li>
              <p>While there are definitely people who do choose to ride without purchasing a ticket, this would be a bad idea. Metro police conduct random train searches for exactly these types of people. If you are caught riding without a vaild ticket you will be asked to leave the train and will be written a ticket. In many cases, offenders will have to attend court and/or pay a fine.</p>
              <p>It's awkward when you get caught doing something that was wrong, so don't do it. Save yourself the trouble and just buy the ticket.</p>

              <li><b>Taxi</b></li>
              <p>Just like many other major cities, St. Louis has many taxi companies. But if you are from a place like New York, don't come here expecting the taxi services to be the same.</p>
              <p>There will not be a large number of taxis just waiting around for their next customer, you are probably won't be able to hail a taxi here like you see in the movies. Unless you are at a typical taxi money making spot like the airport, you will need to call and schedule your pick upi time.</p>
              <p>Many taxi companies now also have apps that you can download which expedites the ordering process.</p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li><b>Does St. Louis have Uber?</b></li>
              <p>As of late 2015, Uber joined the St. Louis area. Since its start, Uber has provided thousands of ride to people living in St. Louis.</p>
              <p>Make sure you download the app so you can take advantage of getting discounts on your first ride.</p>
            </ul>
